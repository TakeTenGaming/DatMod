## 3.0.4
### Bugs Fixed
- This release should _finally_ properly fix the Magnet either not pulling items or deleting items without putting them into the player's inventory.. *Fingers crossed*

### Changes
- Adjusted Ore Generation to properly go the maximum amount of chances, rather than 1 below it
- Upped the weight of our Ore Generator from 3 to 5
- Fixed Ore Generation not running at all, because I'm an idiot
- Adjusted a bunch of min/max settings for Ore Generation
- Ores generated should now vary in size, rather than always being the maximum size possible
